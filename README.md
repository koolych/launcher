> [!IMPORTANT]
> .NET Desktop Runtime 8 is required to run the Wauncher. Download it from [**here**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.24-windows-x64-installer).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Wauncher is still a work in progress. Some features are unfinished and you may run into bugs or changes between builds.

## Settings
- `Minimize to System Tray` keeps the launcher running in the background when in-game.
- `Skip Updates` lets you launch the game even when Wauncher detects available updates.
- `Add ClassicCounter to Steam` adds Wauncher to Steam as a non-Steam game and applies Steam artwork automatically.
- `Disable Carousel` turns off the rotating hero images to lower memory usage.
- `Disable Hardware Acceleration` switches Wauncher to software rendering and restarts the launcher automatically.
- `Discord RPC` controls whether Wauncher updates your Discord presence. In some cases, Discord may still show "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive" even when RPC is disabled.
- `Launch Options` lets you pass extra game launch flags such as `-high` or `+fps_max 300`.
- `Verify Game Files` checks your installation and repairs any missing or damaged game files automatically.
